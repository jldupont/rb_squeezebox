Rhythmbox pluging for controlling Squeezebox

Installation
============
There are 3 methods:

1. Use the Ubuntu Debian repository [jldupont](https://launchpad.net/~jldupont/+archive/jldupont)  with the package "rb-squeezebox"

2. Download a 'tag' from the git repo and place the "squeezebox" folder in ".gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

3. Use the "Download Source" function of this git repo and place the "squeezebox" folder in "~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

Note that option #3 isn't preferred as one might get an "unstable" snapshot.
